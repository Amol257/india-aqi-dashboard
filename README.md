## 📦 Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build for production into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | TypeScript type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm run deploy` | Build and deploy to GitHub Pages |

## 🌐 Deployment

This project deploys to **GitHub Pages** using the `gh-pages` package.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `npm run build` then publishes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch. The app is served from the `/india-aqi-dashboard/` base path as configured in `vite.config.ts`.

## 📡 Data Pipeline & Refresh Rate

The dashboard uses a sophisticated hybrid data pipeline to ensure accuracy and performance:

### 1. Daily Server-Side Refresh
Every day at **06:30 AM IST (01:00 UTC)**, a GitHub Action triggers the following workflow:
- **Fetch**: The `fetch_aqi_data.py` script pulls fresh records from the [official Data.gov.in API](https://api.data.gov.in/).
- **Process**: Data is cleaned, aggregated by city, and health impact metrics (like respiratory admission estimates) are calculated.
- **Sync**: The `sync_constants.ts` script patches the frontend's static metadata to ensure search and filtering indices remain current.
- **Deploy**: A fresh build is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

### 2. Live Frontend Polling
- **10-Minute Cycles**: Once the application is loaded in a browser, it performs a local fetch of the `/data/local_aqi.json` file every **10 minutes**.
- **Real-Time UI**: This ensures that if you leave the dashboard open, it will automatically reflect the most recent data ingested by the server without requiring a page reload.

### 3. Data Source
Air quality data is sourced from the **National Air Quality Index (NAQI)** via the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India.
